    <p>Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with <a href="fire.html">Fire</a> and <a href="water.html">Water</a>, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.</p>
