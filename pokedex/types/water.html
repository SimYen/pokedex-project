  <h1>Water Pokémon</h1>
    <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with <a href="fire.html">Fire</a> and <a href="grass.html">Grass</a>, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.</p>
